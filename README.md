🖐 Hello there (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ. * ･ ｡ﾟ I'm not magic nor am I a wizard, but building web apps makes me feel like one.

Currently I work as a software engineer at Allegro.

⚡ Here's a list of cool words I use often:
  - Kotlin, Spring
  - Typescript, Node.js + Express
  - React, Redux, MaterialUI / Styled Components / CSS(SASS) Modules
  - REST APIs / Socket.io
  - MongoDB, MySQL

And some fancy words I've used a few times:
  - Electron (See my [P.I.T.U.S.](https://github.com/MagicznyCzarodziej/PITUS) app)
  - Vue.js + Vuex (TypeScript support + Intellisense sucks, React FTW)
  - Gatsby (used for my portfolio)
  - Stylus
  - C++ (where many of us have started. Not a fan, but it's usefull for coding Arduino boards)

My latest side project is [MamyKlocga](https://github.com/MagicznyCzarodziej/MamyKlocga) - an online interface to play Block Party boardgame created with Kotlin, Spring and React.
I'm extremaly proud of [mHome](https://github.com/MagicznyCzarodziej/mHome) - fully working smart home system based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

You can also see my [portfolio](http://przemyslawpitus.pl/portfolio/), but it's really outdated. [LinkedIn](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/pitus) may be a better place to check my experience.
